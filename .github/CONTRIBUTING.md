# Contributing to AI Trust Layer — Verifiable Receipts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AI Trust Layer — Verifiable Receipts!

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to ensure that all contributions are properly attributed and that contributors have the right to submit their work.

### What is DCO?

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

### How to Sign Your Commits

All commits must be signed with a DCO signature. You can do this by adding the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

Or you can add the signature manually to your commit message:

```
Your commit message

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### DCO Signature Format

The signature must be in the following format:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

- Use your real name (not a pseudonym or username)
- Use a valid email address
- The signature must be on its own line
- There should be a blank line before the signature

### Example

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add new feature for receipt validation

This commit adds a new feature that improves receipt validation
by implementing additional checks for signature verification.

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"
```

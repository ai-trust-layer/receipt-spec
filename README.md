# Receipt Standard (v1.0 draft)
Open, vendor-neutral format for proving AI process integrity per response.
Each receipt includes: model version, policy version, policy hash, input/output commitments, timestamp, public anchors, TrustScore, and a signature.
Verify receipts offline via SDKs (JS/Python) or with a public explorer.

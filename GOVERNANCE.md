# Governance (v1)
- Changes via RFCs in `rfcs/` named `RFC-XXXX-title.md`.
- Semver for spec (v1.x stays backward-compatible).
- Working Group: monthly public call; decisions by lazy consensus, fallback simple majority.

## RFC Process
1) Open a PR with `rfcs/RFC-XXXX-title.md`
2) Discussion: 7â€“14 days
3) Merge on consensus; otherwise vote maintainers.
